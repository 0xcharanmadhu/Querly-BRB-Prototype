## Introduction
Querly is a collaborative project built by Charan, Manoj, and Kavya Goel at BRBBootcamp. Querly is a Web3 query management system designed to address the limitations of traditional Web2 customer support systems. It aims to resolve issues such as:

2. Long wait times and ineffective solutions in traditional ticketing systems, reducing customer trust.
